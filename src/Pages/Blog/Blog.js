            There are four main types of state you need to properly manage in
            your React apps:
          </p>

          <li>Local state</li>
          <li>Global state</li>
          <li>Server state</li>
          <li>URL state</li>
          <h3>Let's cover each of these in detail:</h3>
          <p>
            Local (UI) state - Local state is data we manage in one or another
            component.
          </p>
          <p>
            Global (UI) state - Global state is data we manage across multiple
            components.
          </p>
          <p>
            Server state - Data that comes from an external server that must be
            integrated with our UI state.
          </p>
          <p>
            URL state - Data that exists on our URLs, including the pathname and
            query parameters.

            The Prototypal Inheritance is a feature in javascript used to add
            methods and properties in objects. It is a method by which an object
            can inherit the properties and methods of another object.
            Traditionally, in order to get and set the [[Prototype]] of an
            object, we use Object.getPrototypeOf and Object.

            Unit testing is a type of software testing where individual units or
            software components are tested. Its purpose is to validate that each
            unit of code performs as expected. A unit can be anything you want
            it to be â€” a line of code, a method, or a class.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-4 leading-relaxed text-gray-700">
            Why Do We Need Unit Testing? <br /> To justify any effort in
            business, there must be a positive impact on the bottom line. Here
            are a few benefits to writing unit tests:
          </p>
          <p>
            Unit tests save time and money. Usually, we tend to test the happy
            path more than the unhappy path. If you release such an app without
            thorough testing, you would have to keep fixing issues raised by
            your potential users.
          </p>
          <p>
            Well-written unit tests act as documentation for your code. Any
            developer can quickly look at your tests and know the purpose of
            your functions.
          </p>
          <p>It simplifies the debugging process.</p>

            a JS library, React has a limited sphere of usage, but when bundled
            with other libraries it becomes a powerful solution, making it a
            main competitor of Angular. And this is why:
